HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized language used to create and structure web pages. It is the foundation of the internet, and is essential for anyone looking to build a website or web application.

To begin, let's look at the basic structure of an HTML document. Every HTML document must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML the page is using.

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

Next, we have the `<html>` tag, which tells the browser that this is an HTML document. This tag is always the root element of an HTML page, and all other elements will be nested within it.

`<html>`

Within the `<html>` tag, we have the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. The `<head>` tag contains information about the page, such as the page title and any links to external stylesheets or scripts. The `<body>` tag, on the other hand, contains the actual content of the page, such as text, images, and links.

```html
<html> 
 <head> 
  <title>My Website</title> 
 </head> 
 <body> 
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1> 
  <p>This is where I share my thoughts and ideas.</p> 
 </body> 
</html>
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of the structure of an HTML page, let's look at some common HTML tags and their uses.

The `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used to create headings on a page. The `<h1>` tag represents the most important heading, and each subsequent heading tag represents a lower level of importance.

```html
<h1>This is a level 1 heading</h1> 
<h2>This is a level 2 heading</h2> 
<h3>This is a level 3 heading</h3>
```

The `<p>` tag is used to create paragraphs of text. Any text that appears within a `<p>` tag will be treated as a separate paragraph.

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p> 
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
```

The `<a>` tag is used to create links to other pages or to different parts of the same page. The "href" attribute is used to specify the destination of the link.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
```

The `<img>` tag is used to insert images into a page. The "src" attribute is used to specify the source of the image.

```html
<img src="my-image.jpg" alt="My Image">
```

The `<div>`tag is used to group elements together and apply styles to them. This is a versatile tag that can be used in many different ways.

```html
<div>
 <p>This is the first paragraph.</p> 
 <p>This is the second paragraph.</p> 
</div>
```

These are just a few of the many HTML tags available. There are many more tags that can be used to create more advanced and dynamic pages, but these are the essential ones to get started. With a little practice and exploration, you can master HTML and build amazing websites.
